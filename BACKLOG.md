# BACKLOG.md — kiroxy post-MVP

Moved from the build brief / caught by anti-scope-creep during MVP:

## Phase 2 (post-v0.1.0)

- **OpenAI-compatible surface** `/v1/chat/completions` + `/v1/models` — P1
- **Prompt/response caching** (see kirocc `cache_points` / Quorinex `cache_tracker`) — P2
- **Prometheus metrics exporter** — P2
- **OTel tracing** (kirocc already has the wiring) — P2
- **Inbound rate limiting** (token bucket per API key) — P3 (single-user doesn't need it yet)
- **Dashboard v2** — Vue/React + live charts. v1 (M10) is plain HTML — P3
- **Cost tracking / usage analytics** — P2

## Post-Phase-2

- **Hexos outbound proxy pool** (HTTP/SOCKS5 rotation for VPN users) — P3
- **Hexos provider registry pattern** — groundwork for multi-provider (CodeBuddy revival? Qoder?) — P3
- **Context compression** (aliom-v 3-layer cache + AI summary) — P3
- **Tool Search proxy-side impl** (kirocc has it; requires Anthropic `defer_loading` support) — P3
- **Cloudflare Tunnel integration** (hexos pattern) — P3

## Infra / release

- GitHub Actions CI (go test, go vet, gofmt, govulncheck)
- goreleaser multi-platform binaries
- Homebrew tap
- Docker Hub image + `docker-compose.yml` polish
- Fly.io / Railway / Render one-click deploy guide
- HTTPS via Caddy sidecar config

## Engineering hygiene

- Replace simple LRU pool with weighted LRU (Quorinex's weight-based expansion)
- Add integration tests that run against a real Kiro test account
- govulncheck in gate
- Race-condition test covers account-swap-mid-stream
- Refactor kirocc's reqconv into smaller files (most are already small but some test files are huge)
